# Workshop on Harnessing Genomic tools for Crop Improvement
Topic:Genomic tools(Structure, TASSEL and GAPIT) handling for association studies
Association analysis is one of the potential method to deetct marker-trait associations in a population. With the availability of high quality data and practising powerful statistical tools association analysis results in crop improvement
Topic covers: Structure, TASSEL and GAPIT installation,data handling and result interpretation
Structure : Install from (https://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/structure_software/release_versions/v2.3.4/html/structure.html)
TASSEL: install from(https://tassel.bitbucket.io)
GAPIT: install R package before GAPIT from (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and then install GAPIT packages as per the instructions mentioned in manual in R
